What is your favorite movie?
Resevoir Dogs

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Skiing in the Alps

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Telepathy.  The ability to read the thoughts of the people around you would seriously improve your ability to connect with people.  If you had this power and played your cards right I feel like you could live under the radar, whereas with something like super strength or the ability to fly you would very obviously be superhuman.  I'm thinking about the long term potential consequences.
